# Python Game Project

This Python game was developed as part of the **"100 Days of Code"** Python course. The project demonstrates core programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, control flow, event handling, and graphical interface development using Python's built-in libraries.

##  Game Overview

This is a simple interactive game built using the `turtle` graphics module. It focuses on enhancing logical thinking and understanding the structure of small-scale game development in Python.

Depending on the specific game, features may include:
 Real-time player controls
 Score tracking
 Collision detection
 Object movement and animation
 Game-over conditions and reset logic

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

  **Python 3**
  **Turtle Graphics** for 2D visual output
  **Keyboard event handling** for player interaction
  **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** for structuring game components

##  How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the project files.
3. Open your terminal or IDE and run:

```bash
python main.py
